					<span class="aboutdesc">My name is Vihanga and I currently attend University of Toronto. If a passionate student that is always trying to learn new and exciting things and broaden their knowledge in the field of programming is someone you're looking for, then I'm your guy. I like to think of myself as a full stack developer in the making, I like dabbling in all sorts of areas of programming and trying all sorts of things. I have worked on projects ranging from this website that was created purely from scratch by yours truly to a game of solitaire with my own personal twist, and much more. I have previously worked in two different places which taught me different sets of skills in their own way.</span>

				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<span class="aboutdesc">First I worked as a swim instructor which taught me how to be a leader and work with others. I had to plan a schedule for my kids and make sure they executed it properly. I also had to listen to the feedback of all the kids and adjust the schedule based on what they need to work on more. Secondly I worked as a graphic designer on my co-op term which taught me how to properly manage time and collaborate with others. I had to meet deadlines and make sure things got out when they were supposed to. I also had to  work in a team environment which required me to collaborate with others and pick what we all thought was best for each piece of work rather than what I thought was best.</span>
